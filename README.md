k-means-clustering
==================

Implementation of the simplest clustering algorithm (K-means) using C++. This is an extra credit opportunity for my programming methodology class. 
Since I have been researching in the fileds of information retrieval, and have to work with clustered data, I couldn't resist on
writing my own simple clustering algorithm.
